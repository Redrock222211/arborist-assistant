## 🚀 HOW TO USE

### Adding a New Tree:
1. Open the app and navigate to Tree List
2. Tap "Add Tree"
3. See all 20 collapsible groups
4. Expand groups you need (Photos, Basic Data, etc.)
5. Fill in the fields
6. Uncheck groups you don't need
7. Save the tree

### Export Control:

2. Add form fields to `_buildHealthContent()` and `_buildStructureContent()`
3. Phase 2 & 3 fields can be added incrementally
4. Replace placeholders with real form fields as needed
